# LuckyBits-core
 Official Golang implementation of LuckyBits â€” the first multiplier-based Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, designed for decentralization, innovation, and community-driven development. This repository hosts the core codebase for the LuckyBits network, providing a robust and secure foundation for decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and token ecosystems. LuckyBits introduces gamified mining, with unique multiplier rewards and jackpot-like mechanics.
